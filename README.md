# css-stopwatch
A stopwatch with lap timers built entirely with CSS and HTML

### Known issues
1. Slow touch response in Opera Mobile
2. Doesnt handle relative font-size values very well. Resizing window while animating puts digits out of alignment.
3. Limited to 4 laps because each lap requires 5 lines of CSS. So more are possible.

### Tested and working in
- Internet Explorer 11
- Firefox 49.0.1
- Firefox iOS
- Opera 41.0
- Opera iOS (works but slow touch response)
- Safari 10 Desktop and iOS
- Chrome Desktop, iOS and Android
